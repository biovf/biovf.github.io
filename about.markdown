Hi and welcome to my website!

My name is David Sena and I currently work as a Principal Graphics Engineer at [NaturalMotion Games](https://www.naturalmotion.com/) on CSR2 Racing [CSR Racing 2](https://www.naturalmotion.com/game/csr-racing-2/)
<!-- Insert image of CSR Racing 2 -->

For the past 6 years most of my work has revolved around pushing the quality of real-time graphics on mobile devices. You can see more details on my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidsena/)

In my spare time I enjoy photography and I'm also part of two demoscene groups (Architect and Singularity).
